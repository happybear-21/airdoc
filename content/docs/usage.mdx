# Basic Usage

This guide will walk you through the basic features and how to use them effectively.

## Getting Started

Here's a simple example of how to use our main feature:

```typescript
import { MyComponent } from '@your-project/components';

function App() {
  return (
    <MyComponent
      title="Hello World"
      description="This is a sample component"
    />
  );
}
```

## Common Patterns

### 1. Basic Configuration

```typescript
const config = {
  theme: 'light',
  language: 'en',
  features: ['feature1', 'feature2']
};
```

### 2. Event Handling

```typescript
function handleClick(event: React.MouseEvent) {
  console.log('Button clicked!');
  // Add your custom logic here
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Always use TypeScript for better type safety
2. Follow the component naming conventions
3. Keep your code modular and reusable
4. Write meaningful comments

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the console for error messages
2. Verify your configuration
3. Make sure all dependencies are installed
